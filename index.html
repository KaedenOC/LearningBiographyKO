        <h2>Short biography</h2>
        <p>My name is Ben Halliwell. I was born in Waterville, Maine and after leaving Maine for military service, I
            currently
            live in Dresden, Maine. My wife is a small business owner, a flower farmer, and is in her first commercial
            season.</p>

        <p>After the Marine Corps I graduated from the Penn State University with my BS in Finance. I also passed the
            Certified Financial Planner examination.</p>

        <p>I worked as a financial planner for two years after college with idealistic notions of helping clients get
            "financially sound". Unfortunately that was not what I found to be the reality of my job.
            Many positions for low-level financial planners are contractor roles without benefits. Additionally, the
            leaders
            I was learning from did not seem to share my values.</p>

        <p>I decided to change course and pursue a career in environmental protection and biodiversity.</p>
        
        <p>I would like for people to see with their own eyes the true value of biological diversity, and the extent
            biodiversity that we have lost in the last 100 years.
            I don't believe that reports and statistics will effectively illustrate to the public where we are at this
            time.
            I believe that technology has a huge part to play in allowing each of us to
            experience the natural world how it *could* be and compare that to how it currently is.</p>

        <p>That is what led me to software development. My goal is to develop a program that allows users to see with
            their
            own eyes how far we have come in an extremely short period of time. It is my goal
            to use virtual reality and photogrammetry to make this a reality and to initially deploy the service to
            historically significant locations, National Parks, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and UNESCO World Heritage
            sites.</p>
