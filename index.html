        <h2>Short biography</h2>

        <p>My name is Ben Halliwell. I was born in Waterville, Maine and after leaving Maine for military service, I
            currently live in Dresden, Maine. My wife is a small business owner, a flower farmer, and is in her first
            commercial season.</p>

        <p>After the Marine Corps I graduated from Penn State University with my BS in Finance. I also passed the
            Certified Financial Planner examination. I worked as a financial planner for two years after college with 
            idealistic notions of helping clients get "financially sound". Unfortunately that was not what I found to 
            be the reality of my job. Many positions for low-level financial planners are contractor roles without 
            benefits. Additionally, the leaders I was learning from did not seem to share my values.</p>

        <p>I decided to change course and pursue a career in environmental protection and biodiversity.</p>

        <p>My goal is to offer everyone the opportunity to see the value of biological diversity and the extent of 
            biodiversity loss in the last 100 years. I don't believe that reports and statistics will effectively 
            illustrate to the public where we are at this time. I believe that technology has a huge part to play in 
            allowing each of us to experience the natural world how it *could* be and compare that to how it currently is.</p>

        <p>This goal led me to software development. I want to develop a program that allows anyone, anywhere to see with
            their own eyes how far we have come in an extremely short period of time. It is my goal to use a combination of
            photogrammetry and volumetric video to make this a reality and to initially deploy the service to historically 
            significant locations, National Parks, Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and UNESCO World Heritage sites.</p>
